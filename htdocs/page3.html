		         <h2> Why do People Choose to Bully Others? </h2>
		            <p> Bullies tend to be seen as purely malicious people who hurt others without reason, however, someone’s tendency to hurt others can be a result of their own mental or emotional problems. Some bullies may feel jealous of someone who has something that they don’t.  This leads to them bullying that person. On the other hand, some bullies may feel inferior to others around them for various reasons, resulting in them resorting to hurting others to feel more powerful and superior. Other personal problems that can lead to a person choosing the path of bullying can be deeply rooted in their upbringing. Examples of this are having violent parents or siblings and being instilled with prejudice from a young age. None of these reasons justify the pain and suffering that they inflict upon others but it is important to understand that they are also human. They can still turn back from being bullies if someone were to acknowledge and help them deal with their problems. </p>

		         <h2> What do I do as a bully? </h2>
		            <p> If you are a bully yourself who goes through these problems, be empathetic. Bullying others only serves to hurt them and even you in the long run since not dealing with your own problems and instead projecting them on others is never the right thing to do. Despite this, remember that it isn’t over for you. Once you’ve realized that your actions were wrong, apologize to the people you’ve hurt and promise that you’ll never do them again. Of course, this isn’t enough but it is a step in the right direction. Lastly, know that you can also seek help. Instead of hurting others because of your own problems, talk to someone about them. It could be a teacher, a friend, or a trusted adult. Solving your problems this way is infinitely better than hurting others to distract yourself from them. </p>
