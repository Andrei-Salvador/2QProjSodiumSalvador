		         <h2> Traditional Bullying vs Cyberbullying </h2>
		            <p> Before we get into how to deal with bullying, we must first become acquainted with the two main types, Traditional Bullying and Cyber Bullying. Traditional bullying can be classified as any bullying that happens in person. On the other hand, according to bark.us, Cyberbullying can be classified as any bullying that happens on the internet. Unlike traditional bullying, Cyberbullying can happen at anytime and anywhere as long as the victim has access to the internet. This makes it harder for a victim of this type to find a safe place away from their bullies.  Listed below are the possible actions you can take if you become a victim of either type of bullying. </p>

			     <ul>
			        <li> Ask for help. Tell a teacher or your family members about your situation. </li>
				    <li> Stand up for yourself by telling your bully about how their actions make you feel. </li>
					<li> Ignore your bully. If you don't react to their actions, they might stop doing them. </li>
				    <li> If you're being cyberbullied, report the person bullying you to the website or app. </li>
				    <li> Take a break from social media. It is a place filled with many bullies and toxicity. </li>
